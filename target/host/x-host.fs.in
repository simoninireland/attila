\ Driver file for host cross-compilation
\
\ This file can re-create the development image for Attila, and serves
\ as a model for other drivers for differemt targets

include cross-compiler/cross-target.fs

\ Set up host development system's include path, as set
\ when the system was installed
S" target/host:@datadir@:@datadir@/target/host" SET-CROSS-COMPILER-TARGET-INCLUDE-PATH

\ Other paths will be relative to this
