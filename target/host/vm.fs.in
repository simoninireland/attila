\ Virtual machine description, host system
\
\ This file is pre-processed to generate the necessary
\ definitions, typically in C. It should contain only
\ simple code such as CONSTANT and USER declarations.
\
\ To cross-compile to other targets, use this file as a model
\ and define the various elements. You *must* make sure that the
\ cell size and character size are right (long ints for C-based
\ compilations), and that the endianness of the process is correct.
\ You can reduce the stack sizes, but development systems will require
\ a data stack of around 50 to accommodate some of the compiler
\ structures, and cross-compiling animage needs a stack of about 100
\ to handle the deep nesting of includes and the extensive use of
\ word lists.

\ Core sizes
@CELL_SIZE@ CONSTANT /CELL
@CHARACTER_SIZE@ CONSTANT /CHAR

\ Endianness of the processor:
\   0 = little-endian
\   1 = big-endian
@BIGENDIAN@ CONSTANT BIGENDIAN?
