\ Driver file for host cross-compilation

\ ---------- Phase 1 cross-compiler set-up ----------
\ - Load the cross-compiler
\ - Load the virtual machine description

\ Load the cross-compiler
include cross-compiler/cross-compiler.fs

.( Initialising cross-compiler view of target VM...)
<cross-compiler also cross-compiler
include vm.fs
cross-compiler>


\ ---------- Minimal image population ----------
\ - Set up the image
\ - Load really basic primitives, inner interpreter

.( Initialising cross-compiler target image...)
[cross] initialise-image

.( Initialising image with really basic primitives...)
<target
C: USERVAR uservar ( n -- addr )
  addr = (CELL) &image[n];
;C

include c-core.fs
include c-flat-memory-model-runtime.fs
include c-itil.fs
target>


\ ---------- Phase 2 cross-compiler set-up ----------
\ - Load control structures
\ - Load hooks support

.( Initialising cross-compiler support...)
<cross-compiler also cross-compiler
\ loop support
include cs-stack.fs
include loop-support.fs

\ loop cross-compilation
include conditionals.fs

\ ---------- Image finalisation and output ----------
\ - Patch image with final pointers
\ - Save image to disc ready for (cross-)compilation

.( Setting hooks and vectors)
<TARGET
\ Initial vectors
' START (START)   XT!   \ cold start vector (first word executed)
' OUTER EXECUTIVE XT!   \ executive (outer interpreter)

\ Hooks

.( Finalising target image...)
[CROSS] FINALISE-IMAGE

.( Saving target image...)
