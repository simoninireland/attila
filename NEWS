Attila history
==============

version 0.3
	- renamed colonhelpers.fs as base.fs, as a single location
	  for "primitives" that don't need to be in the VM core
	- moved base.fs to the front of the standard prelude
	- implemented a separated namespace, codespace and dataspace
	  memory model, which highlighted some memory problems
	  elsewhere
	- added announcement and copyright to the binary
	- changed how re-direction of START-DEFINITION, END-DEFINITION
	  and FIND work in the initial dictionary
	- changed CONSTANT to be standards-compliant, and added
	  VALUE ... TO as well
	- fixed /MOD to be standards-compliant, added */MOD and
	  derived /, MOD and */ from these primitives
 	- split primitives.c and interactive.c into a finer decomposition
	  of primitives by function
	- fixed the counting behaviour of PICK, RPICK and ROLL to treat
	  0 as the top of the stack
	- made vocabularies the unit of dictionary memory management
	  within the VM, split-out some primitives and changed the
	  Attila words accordingly
	- added locals.fs with local definitions of symbolic names
	  for arguments to a word
	- refactored ANS and Gforth (stack comment style) locals
	- added INTERPRET/COMPILE for compile-state-dependent definitions,
	  and used it to refactor various words
	- moved TIB reference into user area
	- started maintaining an offset into the TIB rather than a
	  current pointer, to support >IN
	- added TIB and >IN as user variables

version 0.2 (12May2007)
	- Added CASE construction
	- Introduced COMPILE, and used it in the prelude code
	- Added dynamic memory word set (no RESIZE yet)
	- Fixed loading of source code from package data directory

version 0.1 (21Feb2007)
	- Placed under version control
	- First reasonably usable version
	- Changed project name to Attila (abstract multi-targeted
	  threaded interpreter)
	- Include paths for source code
	- Command-line options and automatic prelude loading

version 0.0.2 (28Jan2007)
	- Switched to more abstract dictionary module, hiding the
	  details of the layout of words

version 0.0.1 (19Jan2007)
	- Initial version able to build itself
