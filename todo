Immediate list of to-dos
------------------------

String constants, including for cross-compilation

Allow constant creation on target during cross-compilation (refactor CROSS-COMPILING? etc)

Better character parsing, for control characters and backslash-escapes

Modular number/word parsing, using hooks again?

Simplify cross-compiler structure (again)
