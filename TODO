Immediate list of to-dos
------------------------

Include paths

String constants, including for cross-compilation

Refactor flat-memory-model.fs, itil.fs and c-itil.fs to minimise duplication

Allow constant creation on target during cross-compilation (refactor CROSS-COMPILING? etc)

Better character parsing, for control characters and backslash-escapes

Start-up and warm-start hooks

Modular number/word parsing, using hooks again?

Simplify cross-compiler structure (again)
